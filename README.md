Taking a look into the winners of Westminster competition

Import's used:

My dataset is the Westminster competition's results since 1907 to last year. I wanted to find out a few things about the competition. 

1. What breed of dog has won the most from the beginning of the competition?
2. Next question, are there any owners on the list that have won more than one?
3. Which category has the most wins in it?

This was created in Jupyter Notebook.
